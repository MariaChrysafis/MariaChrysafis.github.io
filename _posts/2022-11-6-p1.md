Treaps are an extremely powerful and perhaps underrated data structure. But before delving into what a treap can do, it is worth looking at binary search trees--arguably one of the simplest data structures. 
## Binary Search Trees
Binary search trees are nothing more than *special* binary trees that satisfy what's called the **binary search tree property**:
- The keys in a node's **left** subtree is strictly **smaller** than the key of the node itself.
- The keys in a node's **right** subtree is strictly **larger** than the key of the node itself.

Perhaps at first, this may seem like a rather arbitrary definition. But indeed, it proves quite useful. 
### Adding a Node
### Adding a Node Complexity
Suppose we have a random BST with $n$ nodes: that is, a BST built from a *random* permutation $p$ of $[n]$. Now, suppose further that we are searching for a node with some random value $x$ in the range $1...n$. What is the expected number of operations needed to find the node with the key $x$?
 
We know that the root of our tree is $p[0]$ and therefore, each root value is some random number from $1...n$. 

**Claim:** The expected number of queries $q(n)$ is $\le H_n$.

**Proof:** There is a $\frac{1}{n}$ chance that we only need one query, that is, a $\frac{1}{n}$ chance that $x = p[0]$. 

In the other case that $x \ne p[0]$:
- **Case 1:** $x > p[0]$. We recurse down to the left subtree of $x$, which will have $x - 1$ elements: $1 \dots x - 1$.
- **Case 2:** $x < p[0]$. We recurse down to the right subtree of $x$, which will have $n - x$ elements: $x + 1 \dots n$.
Keeping this in mind, 
\begin{align}
q(n) &= 1 + \frac{1}{n^2} \sum_{x = 1}^n \left( \sum_{r = 1}^{x - 1} q(x - 1) + \sum_{r = x + 1}^n q(n - x) \right) \newline
&= 1 + \frac{1}{n^2} \sum_{x = 1}^n q(x - 1) \cdot (x - 1) + q(n - x) \cdot (n - x) \newline
&=  1 + \frac{2}{n^2} \sum_{x = 1}^{n - 1} q(x) \cdot x
\end{align}
There we have a recurrence relation.

### Finding the kth Element
It turns out that we can recursively find the $k$th smallest key (0-indexed) in our binary search tree in $\mathcal{O}(\text{depth})$, if we know the size of the subtrees at each node. To do so, consider the following algorithm:
- Initialize our current node `cur` to be the tree's root.
- If the subtree size of the left child of `cur` is less than $k$, then we know that the $k$th smallest element lies in the left subtree of `cur`, so we can recurse to `cur = cur.left`.
- If the subtree size of the left child of `cur` is equal to $k$, then we know that our current node has the $k$th smallest key. Return `cur`.
- If the subtree size of the right child of `cur` is greater than $k$, then we know that the $k$th smallest element is in the right subtree of `cur`. Thus, we can recursive to `cur = cur.right` and set $k = k - 1$ - `cur.right.size`.
