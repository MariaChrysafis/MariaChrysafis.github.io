title: Treaps

Treaps are an extremely powerful and perhaps underrated data structure. But before delving into what a treap can do, it is worth looking at binary search trees--arguably one of the simplest data structures. 
## Binary Search Trees
Binary search trees are nothing more than *special* binary trees that satisfy what's called the **binary search tree property**:
- The keys in a node's **left** subtree is strictly **smaller** than the key of the node itself.
- The keys in a node's **right** subtree is strictly **larger** than the key of the node itself.

Perhaps at first, this may seem like a rather arbitrary definition. But indeed, it proves quite useful.

### Adding a Node Complexity
Suppose we build a BST from a random permutation. Let $q(n)$ be the average number of nodes on the path from the root down to an arbitrary node in the BST.

<div class="claim">
$q(n) \le 2 \cdot H_n$, where $H_n$ is the $n$th Harmonic number.
</div>

<div class="proof">
\begin{align}
q(n) &= 1 + \frac{1}{n^2} \sum_{x = 1}^n \left( \sum_{r = 1}^{x - 1} q(x - 1) + \sum_{r = x + 1}^n q(n - x) \right) \newline
&= 1 + \frac{1}{n^2} \sum_{x = 1}^n q(x - 1) \cdot (x - 1) + q(n - x) \cdot (n - x) \newline
&=  1 + \frac{2}{n^2} \sum_{x = 1}^{n - 1} q(x) \cdot x
\end{align}
There we have a recurrence relation.

### Finding the kth Element
It turns out that we can recursively find the $k$th smallest key (0-indexed) in our binary search tree in $\mathcal{O}(\text{depth})$, if we know the size of the subtrees at each node. To do so, consider the following algorithm:
- Initialize our current node `cur` to be the tree's root.
- If the subtree size of the left child of `cur` is less than $k$, then we know that the $k$th smallest element lies in the left subtree of `cur`, so we can recurse to `cur = cur.left`.
- If the subtree size of the left child of `cur` is equal to $k$, then we know that our current node has the $k$th smallest key. Return `cur`.
- If the subtree size of the right child of `cur` is greater than $k$, then we know that the $k$th smallest element is in the right subtree of `cur`. Thus, we can recursive to `cur = cur.right` and set $k = k - 1$ - `cur.right.size`.
