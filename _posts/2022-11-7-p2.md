In a **treap**, each node has two values:
- A a random ```priority```. 
- A ```value```.

The values in a treap satisfy the binary search property, and the priorities in a treap satisfy the min-heap property. 

There are two simple, yet powerful, operations treaps can do: splitting and merging.
- For any value $x$, you can split a treap into two treaps: one with keys $\le x$ and another with keys $> x$.
- If all keys in one treap are strictly smaller than all keys in another treap, then we can merge those two treaps.

The worst case time complexity for both of these operations is $\mathcal{O}(N)$, but on average, they run in $\mathcal{O}(\log N)$, making them extremely fast in practice. 

# Splitting
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
pair<Node*, Node*> split (Node* node, int x) { //<= x and >= x
    if (node->x <= x) {
        if (!node->right)
            return make_pair(node, nullptr);
        auto p = split(node->right, x);
        node->right = p.first;
        update(node);
        return make_pair(node, p.second);
    } else {
        if (!node->left)
            return make_pair(nullptr, node);
        auto p = split(node->left, x);
        node->left = p.second;
        update(node);
        return make_pair(p.first, node);
}
```
